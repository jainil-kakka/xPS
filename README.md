# xPS
Welcome to our GitHub repo on football pressing strategies. We explore the shift from 'Total Pressing' in the 1970s to modern 'Gegenpressing,' aiming to balance aggressive pressing with defensive stability through data-driven insights.

# Data Source
For our project, we are implemeting the Statsbomb data source. Their dataset includes detailed spatial data captured via 360-degree tracking and comprehensive event data for several matches. The spatial data offers a nuanced view of player positions and movements throughout the match, while the event data records specific actions such as passes, shots, and defensive maneuves.
